# Cursors
Creating so many cursors on your screen so that you will never find where the cursor is.

TODO: A screenshot here

The project was inspired by a conversation with one of a my friends. He said the 27' screen of iMac is too big so it's impossible for the user to find where the cursor is. So I thought: why not make it even harder?
